# Improve p5.js unit tests
### by Urvashi Verma ([@ihsavru](https://github.com/ihsavru))

## Overview
This project focused on improving the unit tests for different modules of p5.js. I spent my summer writing unit tests for different modules. I also worked on integrating the code coverage reports with Codecov through Travis CI. As of writing this report, the code coverage has been increased to 62.37%.

## Contributions during GSoC'19
I divided the timeline into smaller periods of a week or two to handle unit tests for each module. Following is a list of PRs submitted:
#### Core
- https://github.com/processing/p5.js/pull/3772
- https://github.com/processing/p5.js/pull/3865

#### Events
- https://github.com/processing/p5.js/pull/3824
- https://github.com/processing/p5.js/pull/3814
- https://github.com/processing/p5.js/pull/3810

You can find the code coverage for p5.js on [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/processing/p5.js)

### Documentation
I have documented about how to approach writing a unit test in the [developer docs for unit testing](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/master/developer_docs/unit_testing.md) which was created by my mentor [Evelyn](https://github.com/outofambit).

## Acknowledgements
I am glad to be able to spend my summer contributing to p5.js. I would like to thank my mentor [Evelyn Masso](https://github.com/outofambit), for her support throughout the summer and for making sure that I had enough opportunities to grow during the project. I would also like to thank other members of the Processing Foundation for this opportunity and their help in making this project successful.
